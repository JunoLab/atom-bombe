# The Bombe

*The Bombe* provides a simple way to encrypt plain text files and work with them seamlessly.
The `Encrypt` command ensures that the file is saved in an encrypted form, and when a
previously encrypted file is opened it will automatically be decrypted (assuming you
know the password, of course). It might prove useful if you're currently storing all your
passwords in plain text in a dropbox folder â€“ not that I would do that, obviously.
